This side, sir. The power master. Good afternoon, madam. I am Deshpande speaking, Pandran Deshpande. Regarding this, the recommendations that come, in that, the normal stock equity that we do, according to its recommendations, there are two types.

What is the difference between normal margin and MPF, right? Yes, yes, yes, exactly, exactly. If you take normal margin, like in delivery, then your margin, that is, whatever position you buy on the margin, you can hold it for five days only. Otherwise, your position will be spiked. And in MPF, you can hold it for 90 days. So what happens in MPF, your shares are auto-pledged, in which you get a link in the evening, to pledge shares. And this is not the case in normal margin. There is no share pledge in normal margin. It is held for five days only. Sir, how many days do you have to pledge? Can you pledge after four or five days? No, no, no. It is not like that, sir. If you have bought something in MPF today, then you have to go to the link on the same day, at night, by 9 o'clock, to pledge your share. You have to approve that link, sir. If you do not approve that link, then it will be counted in your normal delivery only. The debit will go, then in five days, your holding will fail. Okay, okay, this is the thing. Sir, what is the procedure, if we take a pledge in MPF? Does it get any message till night? What do we have to do? What is our procedure in that? If you buy in MPF, then you receive SMS at a time, from the CDSL, and at night, at 9 o'clock, you get a link on the mail, to pledge, to approve. Mail? Yes, yes. To approve in that? That's it, right? Yes, you have to approve that link. That's it, that's it. Later, to exit, to square off, how to do that, as we normally do, we have to do that only. No, no, you have to square off in MPF only. Yes, in MPF only, how to do that? Yes, in normal only, yes. Like, if you buy in delivery, then square off in delivery. If you buy in MPF, then square off in MPF. Okay, you can square off in whatever it is, right? Yes, absolutely. Okay, okay, okay madam, understood, understood. Yes. Okay. Sir, any other information for this? No, no, no. Okay.

He told me that he will make me do trading. By doing trading, Madam, you will get 1 lakh rupees. In a month, I will give you 15 to 20,000 rupees.

Rs. 50 for buying? Yes, Sir. But he said, Rs. 20 for buying. He said, Rs. 25 for buying. No, Madam, you are right. You are telling me. Listen to me. Yes, Sir.

We have a recording on our phone. Okay. Who told you that, Sir? Did he tell you about your sub-broker? Madam, don't run away. Because your sub-broker is in the hands of the sub-broker. That man's name is Amit. He didn't say sub-broker. He said, Manoj Gupta. And he said, I am calling from Choice Broking. I have sent the link of Choice Broking.

Yes, Sir. But Madam, actually, if you do this, then how will it be, Madam? Yes, Sir. You will say, yes, Sir, open it. Like you are saying, this is not right, this is not right. We trust you, Madam. If everyone does not trust each other, then how will the world work, Madam? You should have given full information earlier. No, what is full information? There is also wrong information. Like you are saying that the brokerage will cost Rs. 30. Now you are saying Rs. 50. So, we have to trust each other, Madam. No, Sir, I am telling you what is happening here. Rs. 50 is going according to the per lot. And the second thing is, Madam, I am saying the same, Madam. I cannot do everything. You say, we wrote, you ticked, you accepted the government condition. I agree. I am not giving you wrong information. I accept my mistake. What is my mistake? I trusted you very soon. That man, that man, he did this, he did that. He has our capital, he has also incurred 80% loss. And the brokerage has also increased. He made us keep Rs. 25 and Rs. 50. You can also say that we are a bit stupid. You can say that we are stupid. Madam, you are right. No, no, Madam, you are right. It happens, Madam. Whether it is a cash broker or anyone else. Ultimately, in the end, there is defamation, cash broking. It happens, doesn't it, Madam? Now we will close our account. And we will tell five people, don't do cash broking. Like we do trading. Our friend, Sir Kalwant ji, people do trading. Yes, Sir. So, we will also tell people, don't do cash broking. So, at that stage, there is negative campaigning in your brand name. Yes, Sir. Nothing will happen. You see, you have taken Rs. 80,000. What will we do? We will celebrate 2 days, 3 days, 4 days. This is what happens, Madam. If a person misleads, gives wrong information. I am telling you. You should take their full support. Sir, if anyone tells you that he is talking to Choice, how can you trust him? Of course, Madam, I will not trust him. But when they send links, Sir, take this link. Look at this, the link of Trust Green. No, no, no, Madam, listen. There is no problem. You don't take the link from us. You download it from Google Play Store. We are from Google Play Store. They had sent the link. But we did not take their link. We downloaded it from Google Play Store. We did not do it on their request. We doubt that it will come to us. We have downloaded it from Google Play Store. Yes, but we are telling you what they have told us about cash broking. It takes so much money. We will give them tips. We have to get some commission. We will get that tip every day. The brokerage tip is Rs. 25 per trade. We are telling you that. I mean to say, after coming to their talks, what they have told us, look, you have to do this, you have to do that. After coming to their talks, they took our money. After taking our money, they did not get anything. We suffered a loss. What did they get? They did not get anything. We suffered a loss. What did they get? What can the company do? The company can do this. The person who misled us, he should take action against him. You are such a person, you are a sub-broker. If he was a sub-broker, if he was a member of Choice, then the team could have taken action against him. He is a member of Choice, you can check. He will be a member of Choice. He will be a sub-broker. You can take action against him. No, sir. Do you have an account? No, sir. Do you have an account under Pragya Rai? Under which? Under Pragya Rai.

A GST of Rs. 2,782 got deducted. I told you that your brokerage charges are Rs. 50 per lot in OptionTrading. Your brokerage charges will be deducted according to Rs. 50 per lot. Rs. 50 per lot means Rs. 15,000 will be deducted. Sir, your brokerage charges will be deducted according to Rs. 50 per lot. So, your brokerage charges will be Rs. 15,300.

Because, in the same documents, the online account is opened only once. What if I don't open an offline account? If you can open an offline account, there won't be any issue. Yes, I will open an offline account. Please let me know. I will go. First, talk to your franchisee. They will reduce your brokerage charges. If there is no issue, you can proceed with the process.

He reduced it to Rs. 40,000. Then it was Rs. 30,000. I got Rs. 10,000. He reduced it to Rs. 20,000. The day before yesterday, I got Rs. 32,000. I got Rs. 18,000.

Sir, I don't understand how my short is at Rs.35,000 when I work in options. Sir, you are working in options. Today you have kept the HGFC script till yesterday. Month end has expired. In that, you have to keep a margin of Rs.3,000. Sir, margin is required. How is the shortage of funds, sir? Margin, tell me one thing. I took Rs.11,000 or Rs.5,500. My Rs.5,500 is fixed. Now, even if it is 0. No, sir. You have taken the HGFC script of 27th June. Okay. So, month end has expired. In that, you have to keep a margin in the fund. Tomorrow, you will have to keep Rs.30,000 or Rs.60,000 in the account. Sir, what is the meaning of short in options? Sorry? I am not doing short in options. Sir, I am doing short in futures. If you take the month end's expiry in options, then you require a margin in that. Now, you are buying the script of HGFC of 27th June. There will be a balance in the account to buy it. Then only you will be able to buy it. The balance of the script, there will be a balance of Rs.3,000 in the account to buy it. Then only you will be able to buy it. Sir, if the balance of Rs.5,500 is 0, then it will be Rs.5,500. In that, I have an extra option. Yes, but in the script, you have to keep the fund in the account in the month end's expiry. Sir, if the penalty is imposed today, then you will have to pay Rs.500 penalty today. Yes, sir. You will have to pay the penalty today. You will have to add the amount of negative fund. You will have to keep the balance in the account. Sir, I will close your account tomorrow. Sir, I will close your account tomorrow. You will have to pay the penalty today. Sir, it is not an issue. I will tell you the process. Sir, it is your issue. Sir, there is a clear cut in the options. Sir, I will work in the future. Sir, whether it is expiry or something else, I have to keep the amount in the fund. If it is 0, then I will get the money. It is not going above that. So, from where will I have to keep the fund, sir? You have to keep the fund in the account in the month end's expiry. Sir, I have worked in NGM also. You will have to pay the penalty there also. You will have to keep the fund there. Your balance will be blocked. Okay? Okay, sir. I will close my account tomorrow. Sir, do you want to know anything else? No, sir.
